									<h1>My Story</h1>
									<p>A history of what I've done, where I've been and where I plan to go.</p>
								</header>
								
								<p>Dutch courage is a wonderful thing, not a typical way to start an “about me” story I know, but it led me to making one of the best decisions of my life.</p> 

									<p>To set the scene, 10 years ago I made the trip to Sydney with my mother to attend a food festival that would slingshot me into the world of real kitchens. There were the best chefs from all over the country, international chefs and prominent members of the hospitality scene that I thought were gods and it was an honor to even be in the same room as them.</p>
									<p>After one morning talk, several chefs sat at tables signing books and having photos taken with guests. I lined up waiting for my turn without actually having a book, I just wanted the photo. We took our photo, shook hands and as he sat down and I was about to walk away I stopped and turned back to ask, in my courageous state thanks to a cocktail stand, Neil Perry for a job in one of his kitchens.
									</p>
									<p>Fast forward 8 years and that question has taken me to the best kitchens in Sydney to London and back. It was hard work and I learned a heck of a lot about myself and what I was capable of. But 70 hours a week began to take its toll on me and I started to look around for something that I could use all my knowledge from. I found a BDM role with a hospitality ordering platform where I could lever my food knowledge and learn a new set of skills.
									</p>
									<p>As it would turn out, my desk was behind the gun dev team they had and I was forever peaking over at their screens watching them type away. During highschool I had done coding and really enjoyed it but after falling into the world of kitchens my dreams of coding were all but stopped. Sitting at this desk however reminded me of this and thoughts of making a move to that world were watered, not to mention the developers were some of the nicest people I had ever had the pleasure of working with. 
									</p>
									<p>I had frequent chats with them towards the end of my time there with how best to go about stepping into this world and they set me on a path that I would journey down to this current point in time. From there I completed a cert 4 in web-based technologies at tafe and built tiny projects along the to try and  improve my understanding of how everything works. 
									</p>
									<p>I am beyond excited to step into the world of web development. To work on products that make a difference and to push myself to become the best developer I can be.
